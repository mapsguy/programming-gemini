            "This report details an experiment investigating electric field and voltage distribution on a 28 cm x 20 cm conducting paper sheet, comparing empirical measurements to theoretical models. The study explored two scenarios: an unmodified sheet and one with four cut-out insulators. Voltage measurements were taken at various points to generate visualizations of voltage distribution, electric fields, and charge density.\n",

            "The experimental findings for the unmodified paper generally corroborated theoretical predictions, exhibiting smooth voltage gradients. However, observed deviations—such as warped voltage distributions near edges and non-uniform electric field vectors—were attributed to measurement errors and environmental factors like uneven paper conductivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "A key finding was that the introduction of insulators significantly disrupted the voltage and electric field distributions, creating steep local gradients and localized distortions that the initial theoretical models did not account for. Residual analysis further confirmed that while theoretical models provided a good approximation in unaltered regions, they struggled to accurately capture phenomena near boundaries and insulators.\n",

Future work is proposed to develop a theoretical model that incorporates the effects of insulators.\n"
