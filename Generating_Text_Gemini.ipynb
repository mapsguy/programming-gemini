            "\n",

            " are generally needed:\n",
            "    *   **Fuel:** The substance that burns (e.g., wood, paper, natural gas, gasoline, propane, coal, hydrogen). This substance contains chemical energy that will be released.\n",
            "    *\n",
            "   **Oxidizer:** A substance that accepts electrons from the fuel. In most common combustion reactions, this is **oxygen gas (O₂)** from the air.\n",
            "    *   **Activation Energy/Heat:** The initial energy input\n",
            " required to start the reaction (e.g., a spark, a flame, friction, or reaching the ignition temperature). Once started, the reaction usually generates enough heat to sustain itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Process:**\n",
            "    *   When the fuel\n",
            " reaches its ignition temperature in the presence of an oxidizer, the chemical bonds within the fuel molecules break.\n",
            "    *   New bonds form between the atoms of the fuel and the oxygen atoms.\n",
            "    *   This process releases a significant amount of\n",

            "3.  **Exothermic Nature:**\n",
            "    *   Combustion reactions are **exothermic\n",
