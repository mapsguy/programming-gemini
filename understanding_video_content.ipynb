            "Hi _, my name is _ and I'm a senior at the _ . Today, I just wanted to take the chance to walk you through some of the most impactful books I've ever read, just because books have been a pretty significant part of my life since I was very young. So, just to start off, I have The History Book, which I kind of read sporadically on and off between second and third grade. But why I remembered this one so well was that it basically presents every single historical event across all regions throughout the world in one really interconnected narrative. And that's why I loved it so much, because it's so rare to have a class that covers such a wide, long timeline in one year. And so this book really presented history in a singular, accessible timeline and it just, it's stuck with me ever since. So, and next up, I have Sita, which is a retelling of The Ramayana, um, and I read this in sixth grade. And why I loved this so much was that it's a retelling of an ancient epic that I've heard so many times, but all those times I heard it, it was only from the male perspective. So, reading this from the female perspective really gave me a deeper understanding of the themes of the book, specifically sacrifice. And it really helped me learn that, you know, understanding and learning about the multiple perspectives for each event is super important. And I think each time you do learn something new. And finally, I just wanted to introduce Scaling Altruism. So this is a book that I read last summer as I was interning for Mr. _'s altruist nonprofit accelerator. And in this book, he kind of starts from every single practice you need from day one, even with a single person to really build a successful nonprofit organization and the practices you need to take if you want to be a true altruist in society. And so this is pretty eye-opening, knowing that change, and altruistic change, can just start with one person. At _, I really hope to kind of explore that same wide-ranging areas of studies and subjects. And as a student, I'll continue to kind of explore different subjects and topics the same way I have with reading my whole life.\n"
